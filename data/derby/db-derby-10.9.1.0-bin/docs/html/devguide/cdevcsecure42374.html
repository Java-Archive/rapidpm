<h1 class="topictitle1">Working with user authentication</h1>



<div><p><span>Derby</span> provides
support for user authentication and user authorization. <dfn class="term">User
authentication</dfn> determines whether a user is a valid user. It establishes
the user's identity.
<dfn class="term">User authorization</dfn> determines what operations a user's established
identity can perform.
You are strongly urged to implement both authentication and
authorization on any multi-user database used in production.</p>

<p>When user authentication is enabled (by default, it is <em>not</em> enabled), 
the user that requests a connection must provide a valid name and password,
which <span>Derby</span> verifies against
the repository of users defined for the system. After
<span>Derby</span> authenticates the user
as valid, <a href="cdevcsecure36595.html#cdevcsecure36595">user
authorization</a> determines what operations the user can perform on the
database to which the user is requesting a connection.</p>

<p>For user authentication, <span>Derby</span> allows
you to provide a repository of users in a number of different ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can use <span>Derby</span>'s
NATIVE authentication mechanism to store user credentials in a database. See
<a href="cdevcsecurenativeauth.html#cdevcsecurenativeauth">Using NATIVE authentication</a> for
details.</li>

<li>You can hook <span>Derby</span> up to
an external directory service elsewhere in your enterprise.</li>

<li>You can create your own directory service.</li>

<li>You can use <span>Derby</span>'s
simple BUILTIN mechanism for creating a repository of users.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="important"><span class="importanttitle">Important: </span><span>Derby</span>'s
BUILTIN authentication mechanism is suitable only for development and testing
purposes, and it will no longer be documented in future releases. It is strongly
recommended that production systems rely on NATIVE authentication, an
external directory service such as LDAP, or a user-defined class for
authentication. It is also strongly recommended that production systems protect
network connections with SSL/TLS.</div>

<p>You can define a repository of users for a particular database or for an
entire system, depending on whether you use system-wide or database-wide
properties.</p>

<p>When <span>Derby</span> user authentication
is enabled and <span>Derby</span> uses
an external directory service, the architecture looks something like that
shown in the following figure. The application can be a single-user application with
an embedded <span>Derby</span> engine
or a multi-user application server.</p>

<div class="fignone" id="cdevcsecure42374__cdevcsecure32704"><a name="cdevcsecure42374__cdevcsecure32704"><!-- --></a><span class="figcap">Figure 1. <span>Derby</span>
user authentication using an external service</span>
<br /><img src="authentic_os.gif" alt="This figure shows how an application passes Derby user authentication through an external directory service before access to a Derby database is allowed." /><br />
</div>

<p><span>Derby</span> always runs embedded
in another Java application, whether that application is a single-user application
or a multiple-user application server or connectivity framework. </p>

<p>A database can be accessed by only one JVM at a time, so it is possible
to deploy a system in which the application in which <span>Derby</span> is
embedded, not <span>Derby</span>, handles
the user authentication by connecting to an external directory service. The
application can be a single-user application with an embedded
<span>Derby</span> engine or a multi-user
application server. The following figure shows this kind of deployment.</p>

<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecurenativeauth.html">Using NATIVE authentication</a></strong><br />
Derby's simplest authentication mechanism is NATIVE authentication.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure36127.html">Enabling user authentication</a></strong><br />
If you use NATIVE authentication, you do not need to set the derby.connection.requireAuthentication property. When you create a database with NATIVE authentication, simply specify a username and password, and that user becomes the database owner.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure37817.html">Defining users</a></strong><br />
Derby provides several ways to define the repository of users and passwords. To specify which of these services to use with your Derby system, set the property derby.authentication.provider to an appropriate value.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cdevcsecure38522.html">External directory service</a></strong><br />
A directory service stores names and attributes of those names. A typical use for a directory service is to store user names and passwords for a computer system. Derby uses the Java naming and directory interface (JNDI) to interact with external directory services that can provide authentication of users' names and passwords.</li>
