<h1 class="topictitle1">BUILTIN Derby users</h1>



<div><p><span>Derby</span> provides
a simple repository of user names and passwords using the BUILTIN
authentication mechanism.</p>

<div class="important"><span class="importanttitle">Important: </span><span>Derby</span>'s
BUILTIN authentication mechanism is suitable only for development and testing
purposes, and it will no longer be documented in future releases. It is strongly
recommended that production systems rely on NATIVE authentication, an
external directory service such as LDAP, or a user-defined class for
authentication. It is also strongly recommended that production systems protect
network connections with SSL/TLS.</div>

<p>To use the BUILTIN repository, set
<samp class="codeph">derby.authentication.provider</samp> to <samp class="codeph">BUILTIN</samp>.</p>

<pre>derby.authentication.provider=BUILTIN</pre>

<p>You can create user names and passwords for <span>Derby</span> users
by specifying them with the <samp class="codeph">derby.user.UserName</samp> property.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>These user names are case-sensitive for user authentication. User names
are <em>SQL92Identifiers</em>. Delimited identifiers are allowed:
<pre>derby.user."FRed"=java</pre>
</div>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>For passwords, it is a good idea not to use words that would be easily
guessed, such as a login name or simple words or numbers. A password should
be a mix of numbers and upper- and lowercase letters.</div>
